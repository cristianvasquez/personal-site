## Problem

To use the data from a network of interconnected PODs in our day-to-day activities, we need to manage it in a way that is easy to consume; but this is not necessarily an easy task. All people find their ways to organize their data, such as categorizing files in folders, labeling messages, etc. To classify or tag our information effectively is difficult and time-consuming, and we incur high cognitive costs when building relations and describing resources. Furthermore, this organization does not hold for long periods. The attendant fragmentation of personal information increases the probability of keeping something in the wrong place and forgetting something that was seen, heard, or read in the first place.

We want to manage our data so we can interact with others, but how to do it without expending excessive cognitive efforts?

We could go for semi-automatic mechanisms, but this is also complicated not because we don't have algorithms to classify things into categories but because everyone has a different idea about categorizing things. 

No matter how much sense we think they make, our organization schemes inevitably feel alien to everybody else. We learned from the Semantic Desktop efforts that the extraction and organization of the information could not be fully automated, since "the imposition of meaning onto schemas is something the user must do, not the computer."

Our mental models also change, being heavily influenced by our environment and our interactions with others. Our categorization schemes are dynamic.

How we interconnect several dataspaces in a network where the information is decentrally organized?

Instead of categorizing all ourselves, I believe that it is preferable to evolve semantics with our close peers collectively.
