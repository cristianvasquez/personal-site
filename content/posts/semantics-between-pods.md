## Problem

To use the data from a [network of interconnected PODs](../network-of-interconnected-pods) in our day to day activities, we need to manage it in a way that is easy to consume; but this is not necessarily an easy task. All people find their own ways to organize their data, such as categorizing files in folders, labeling messages, etc. To classify or tag our information effectively is difficult and time-consuming, and we incur into high cognitive costs when building relations and describing resources, and furthermore, this organization does not hold for long periods. The attendant fragmentation of personal information increases the probability of keeping something in the wrong place and forgetting something that was seen, heard, or read in the first place.

We want to manage our data in a way we can interact with others, but how to do it without expending excessive cognitive efforts?

We could go for semi-automatic mechanisms, but this is also complicated not because we don't have algorithms to classify things into categories but because everyone has a different idea about how to categorize things. 

Our organization schemes no matter how much sense we think they make inevitably feel alien to everybody else. We learned from the Semantic Desktop efforts that the extraction and organization of the information could not be fully automated, since "the imposition of meaning onto schemas is something the user must do, not the computer."

Also, our mental models also change, being heavily influenced by our environment and our interactions with others. Our categorization schemes are dynamic.

How we interconnect several dataspaces in a network where the information is decentrally organized?

I believe that instead of categorizing all ourselves,  is preferable to evolve semantics with our close peers collectively.
