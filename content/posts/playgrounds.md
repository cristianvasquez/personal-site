## Two possibilities

1. To use shared artifacts to support agreements and exchange employing user-agents that build links and mapping between data-spaces.

2. To transfer artifacts. Build mappings while views are transferred between distinct PODs.

The objective of such networks is to provide a playground where the participants can incrementally describe their shapes or observation subjects, having user-agents that aid the constructions of explicitly shared ontology views using techniques of divergence and convergence among others.

The resulting agreements can be then used by next-generation tools that improve understanding among peers and help individuals to be productive within their personal, organizational and social environments.
