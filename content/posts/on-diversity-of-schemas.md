## Schema diversity in Open information Sytems

Open Information Systems such as Internet put at our disposal various digital channels. People are free to choose or build channels that perform better or more efficiently within each situation. 

If, for example, two persons decide to interact together through the Internet, they might do this by continually exchanging emails, files, publishing pages into a wiki, etc. In the process, they strive to reach an adequate degree of coherence and alignment to allow the interaction. 

Moreover, in the open, interactions also occur at several levels, use different terminology, models, and so on. Several artifacts are continually produced, copied, transformed, and merged with other artifacts. After a while, the peers learn and adopt the new terminology, sometimes modify it to suit their own purposes. The peers eventually re-combine, refine, and represent the terminology in different ways. 

The people's interactions can be seen as a complex system that adapts, where each individual perspective and the collective way of representing the world mutate and self-organize corresponding to the collection of events the peers are subject to.

This chaotic process seems natural.

## The individual and the group

When a group of people is sufficiently big, they might choose to bring up some order in how they model their data. They can build a system that exposes points of access or APIs that make use of explicit general models or schemas, unifying how the information is organized. This is proven to work for the context of a big community, but is this adequate for the individual?

A person might want to have their information modeled in their own terms because it is how the person understands it, and its how the data makes sense to him. However, the individual also wants to use their information in several systems, and many of them will model and understand the data differently. 

How much of the public vocabularies to adopt? and how much personal terminology to use?

I imagine that there can be something in the middle. People can have tools that help them to manage and structure their own information and at the same time refine and expose structured content to other people. Ideally (I imagine), these tools would generate schemas built by the peers themselves which incrementally connect or map together.
